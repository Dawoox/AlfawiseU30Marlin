# Marlin configuration for an Alfawise U30

This is my config for my modded Alfawise U30 running Marlin.

### List of mods applied to the printer

* Installation of a CR-Touch
* Removing of the filament runout sensor *(it broke in 3 months)*

### Credits

The base of the configuration came from [this thread](https://www.lesimprimantes3d.fr/forum/topic/22306-tuto-alfawise-u20x-u30-flasher-marlin-2x-firmware-alternatif/page/9/#comment-326974) on french 3d printer forum but was heavily edited to make it work with newer versions of Marlin as this thread is already 5 years old.
